This directory contains a Nagios check script for the te923 scripts above, as well as a configuration
file for the NRPE daemon to be applied on the host to which the te923 weather station is connected.

Add the following line to the NRPE daemon config file /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg:
     include_dir=/opt/te923/nagios

You can then add Nagios services on your monitor host.  Drop te923_services.cfg into:
     /etc/nagios3/conf.d

Copy weatherhost.cfg.example to /etc/nagios3/conf.d as well, and rename to a more appropriate name
with the .cfg extension.  Edit to point at the server that's got the weather station attached.
