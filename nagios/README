This directory contains a Nagios check script for the te923 scripts above, as well as a configuration
file for the NRPE daemon to be applied on the host to which the te923 weather station is connected.

Add the following line to the NRPE daemon config file /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg:
     include_dir=/opt/te923/nagios

You can then add Nagios services on your monitor host.  Drop te923_services.cfg into:
     /etc/nagios3/conf.d

Then edit /etc/nagios3/conf.d/te923_services.cfg to comment out sensors not attached to your
weather station, and add your weather station host to the te923-servers Nagios hostgroup.
