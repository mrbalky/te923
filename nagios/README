This directory contains a Nagios check script for the te923 scripts above, as well as a configuration
file for the NRPE daemon to be applied on the host to which the te923 weather station is connected.

Add the following line to the NRPE daemon config file /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg:
     include_dir=/opt/te923/nagios

You can then add Nagios services on your monitor host with configuration like that
shown in te923_services.cfg
